Accessing Internal Pages via data stream:
  Explanation... This bypasses a trivial check for validity of domains and external domains.
  It's just eval-ing a base64 encoded payload to bypass the :// check that's looking for the hostname.
  This is the same solution for the niave approach... but, it has a further constraint that we need to
  force the portion of the payload being tested to be in the allow-list. This information could be
  gathered from looking at what options / examples of the service already exist.

  This solution also allows for an attacker be able to use Js that they control
  even if they can't connect to an external server that they have influence / control of.
